<p>Unstratified open-channel flow driven by a constant barotropic pressure gradient</p>

<p>Stress-driven entrainment into a linearly stratified turbulent</p>

<h2 id="couette">Couette</h2>

<p>The Couette scenario is the most basic of all GOTM scenarios. It represents a
shallow (10 m deep), unstratified layer of fluid above a flat bottom that is
driven by a constant surface stress in the x-direction. Earth&rsquo;s rotation is
ignored. This flow is often referred to as turbulent Couette flow. After the
onset of the surface stress, a thin turbulent near-surface layer is generated
that rapidly entrains into the non-turbulent deeper parts of the water column.
The solution at the end of the simulation, when the problem has become fully
stationary, is shown in the figure below. The velocity profile in panel (a)
reveals the existence of two shear layers in the near-surface and near-bottom
regions, respectively, that converge toward that analytical law-of-the-wall
solutions (dashed red lines in the figure). The diffusivity profile in the
turbulent Couette flow is nearly parabolic (panel b), and also converges to the
linear law-of-the-wall solution near the boundaries. The Reynolds stress (or,
likewise, the turbulent momentum flux) shown in panel &copy; is perfectly constant
throughout the water column, and corresponds exactly to the applied surface
stress. This is easily understood from the fact that all momentum entering the
water column at the surface has to leave it again at the bottom under
stationary conditions. The solution shown in the figure has been obtained with
the k-ε model. Solutions for other two-equations models like the k-ω model or
Mellor-Yamada model look similar (you can easily check this in the scenario
directory by typing &ldquo;make komega&rdquo; or &ldquo;make MellorYamada&rdquo; to run GOTM with these
alternative turbulence models). Technical details for this test case are
described in the GOTM documentation. We now also provide the
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xg2ccph2s5zjija/couette.m?dl=0">MATLAB script</a>
used to
generate the figure for this GOTM scenario. Note that only MATLAB 2015a and
higher supports direct reading of NetCDF output.

<h2 id="channel">Channel</h2>

<p>Similar to the idealized <a href="#couette">Couette scenario</a>, also in this test case,
an unstratified, non-rotating water column of 10 m thickness is investigated.
Here, however, the flow is driven by a constant barotropic pressure gradient
resulting from the tilt of the free surface. The surface stress is set to zero.
This type of flow is often referred as turbulent open channel flow. The figure
below shows the stationary solution approached at the end of simulation.
Different from the <a href="#couette">Couette scenario</a>, the velocity profile shown in
panel (a) exhibits only a single shear-layer at the bottom that converges
toward the logarithmic wall layer close to the bottom. The turbulent
diffusivity (panel b) is approximately symmetric but exhibits a slight vertical
asymmetry due to the different boundary conditions at the surface and the
bottom. Also this quantity converges toward the (linear) law-of-the-wall
relation near the bottom. While the turbulent momentum flux is vertically
constant in the <a href="#couette">Couette flow</a>, for the open channel flow we find a
linear variation. The vertical stress divergence is thus constant, and exactly
balances the (constant) pressure gradient throughout the water column. The
solution shown in the figure has been obtained with the k-ε model. Solutions
for other two-equations models like the k-ω model or Mellor-Yamada model look
similar (you can easily check this in the scenario directory by typing &ldquo;make
komega&rdquo; or &ldquo;make MellorYamada&rdquo; to run GOTM with these alternative turbulence
models). Technical details for this test case are described in the GOTM
documentation. We now also provide the

generate the figure for this GOTM scenario. Note that only MATLAB 2015a and
higher supports direct reading of NetCDF output.

<h2 id="entrainment">Entrainment</h2>

<p>The entrainment scenario is similar to the
<a href="/examples/nns/couette/">Couette scenario</a>,
except that the water column is now stably
stratified by a vertically constant density gradient. Also in this scenario,
the effect of Earth&rsquo;s rotation is ignored. The entrainment scenario  is
ideally suited to benchmark the model performance in stress-driven entrainment
situations against available experiments (see
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2004.08.004">Umlauf and Burchard, 2005</a>)
The results shown in the
figure below illustrate that after the onset of the constant surface stress in
the x-direction, a thin near-surface layer is accelerated (panel a), and slowly
entrains into the stratified, non-turbulent interior region. Shear-driven
turbulence in this region is mirrored in the large turbulent diffusivities
shown in panel &copy;, which generate a nearly well-mixed surface layer  that is
separated from the interior by a pycnocline of gradually increasing strength
(panel b). The white dashed line indicates the solution suggested by
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112079002366">Price (1979)</a>
for shear-driven
entrainment into a linearly stratified fluid
[see Eq. (53) in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2004.08.004">Umlauf and Burchard, 2005</a>].
The numerical
solution shown in the figure has been obtained with the k-ε model. Solutions
for other two-equation models available in GOTM look similar. You can easily
check this by modifying the GOTM namelist files to run the k-ω model
(<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1463-5003(02)00039-2">Umlauf et al., 2003</a>)
or the GLS (generic length scale) model described in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1357/002224003322005087">Umlauf and Burchard (2003)</a>.
Technical details for this GOTM scenario may be found in the GOTM documentation.
We now also provide the
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7tlj1kqibon4n4w/entrainment.m?dl=0">MATLAB script</a>
