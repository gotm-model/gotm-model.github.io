<h2 id="flex">Flex</h2>

<p>A data set which has been used throughout the last 40 years as a calibration
for mixing parameterisations has been collected during the measurements of the
<strong>Fladenground Experiment 1976 (FLEX&rsquo;76)</strong> campaign. Starting from a well-mixed
winter situation, a surface mixed layer is established, which is several times
deepened and partly removed by storm events.

Spring temperature development at the FLEX site in the Northern North Sea. This

<a href="/portfolio/img/flex.py">flex.py</a>.
[/caption]
The measurements of meteorological forcing and potential temperature
profiles were carried out in spring 1976 in the northern North Sea at a water
depth of about 145 m and a geographical position at 58 deg 55&rsquo;N and 0 deg 32&rsquo;E.
The simulation is run from April 6 to June 7, 1976. The
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00232256">Kondo (1975)</a>
bulk formulae have
been used for pre-calculating the surface fluxes, which are given in the data
files momentumflux.dat, and heatflux.dat. Other meteorological data files gives
sea surface temperature (sst.dat) and short wave radiation (swr.dat). Tidal
flow is forced by oscillating sea surface slopes (pressure.dat), temperature
profiles for validation are provided directly from CTD (tprof_ctd.dat) or
interpolated from CTD to semi-diurnal profiles (tprof.dat). Salinity from CTD
(s_prof_ctd.dat) or from a 3D model (s_prof.dat) are used for nudging simulated
salinity to &ldquo;observed&rdquo; data at a time scale of 2 days. Six-hourly values for
light extinction are given by extinction.dat. Model simulations similar to
those provided here have been published by
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JC03229">Burchard &amp; Baumert (1995)</a>.
As there, also here a k-epsilon
model is used as turbulence closure model, but here the
<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469(2002)059%3C1550%3AAIMFTT%3E2.0.CO%3B2">Cheng et al. (2002) </a>
stability functions are used.</p>

<h2 id="gotland-deep">Gotland Deep</h2>

<p>These simulations are made for the location of station 271** Central Eastern
Gotland Sea of the Baltic Sea** at 20 deg E and 57.3 deg N with a water depth
of 250 m. Initial conditions for temperature and salinity are derived from
measurements. Meteorological forcing was available from the ERA15 reanalysis
data set. For the penetration of solar radiation into the water column, fairly
turbid water (Jerlov type IB) is assumed. Salinity concentrations are nudged to
observations with a time scale of 50 days.

<a href="/portfolio/img/gotland.py">gotland.py</a>.
[/caption]
The simulation is carried out for the years 1980-1990. For the discretisation,
the water column has been divided into 100 vertical layers, with a strong
zooming towards the surface, resulting in a mean near-surface resolution of
less than 0.5 m. The time step for these simulations is set to 10 minutes. For
details of the gotland scenario see
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2005.04.011">Burchard et al. (2006)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="liverpool-bay">Liverpool Bay</h2>

<p>The observations for this scenario have been carried out by
<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0485(2001)031%3C2458:TCOTDI%3E2.0.CO%3B2">Rippeth et al (2001}</a>
in the** Liverpool Bay ROFI** on July 5 and 6, 1999 at a position of 53 deg
28.4&rsquo;N, 3 deg 39.2&rsquo;W. The dissipation rate measurements were carried out with a
FLY shear probe mounted on a free-falling profiler. Sensors for temperature and
conductivity attached to the profiler give detailed information on the vertical
density distribution during each cast. Nearby, an ADCP was mounted on the
bottom, giving information on the vertical velocity structure. Some
accompanying CTD casts were made in order to achieve estimates for the
horizontal gradients of temperature and salinity. The surface fluxes are
calculated externally by means of bulk formulae of
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00232256">Kondo (1975)</a>
, where the sea
surface temperature from measurements (FLY profiler) has been used. The bed
roughness has been estimated from near-bed ADCP measurements as z0 = 0.0025 m
by means of fits to the law of the wall. The external pressure gradient due to
surface slopes is estimated according to a method suggested by
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X99000086">Burchard (1999)</a>
by means
of adjustment to near bed velocity observations. The horizontal salinity and
temperature gradients for a typical summer situation are prescribed. The
observations and model results show a clear SIPS (Strain-Induced Periodic
Stratification) cycle with mixed conditions after flood (at high water) and
stratified conditions after ebb (low water). The numerical simulations of this
scenario have been described in
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434302000250">Simpson et al. (2002)</a>.

<h2 id="northern-ns-seasonal">Northern NS (Seasonal)</h2>

<p>This <strong>Northern North Sea seasonal experiment</strong> has been carried out in the
framework of the PROVESS (PROcesses of VErtical mixing in Shealf Seas) project
(MAS3-CT97-0025, 1998-2001) which has been funded by the European Communities
MAST-III program. The observations in the Northern North Sea were carried out
in September and October 1998. Here, a period of 20 days from October 7 - 27,
1998 is simulated. All forcing and validation data have been carefully
processed from observations during this PROVESS-NNS experiment.

profiler. This plot was created with
<a href="/portfolio/img/nns_seasonal.py">nns_seasonal.py</a>.
[/caption]
Two different observed dissipation rate data sets are
included: eps_fly.dat: data from a FLY profiler, processed by School of Ocean
Sciences, University of Bangor, Wales eps_mst.dat: data from an MST profiler,
processed by the Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. These files are read in
into GOTM through the eobs namelist in obs.nml. The dissipation rate has only
been observed at short intervals, periods without observations are set to
minimum values in the files. These dissipation rate observations are read in
into GOTM in order to allow for proper interpolation to the temporal and
spatial output steps, and they are not used for any type of nudging. The data
files are prepared such that the maximum simulation interval can be extended to
September 7 at 10.00 h - November 2 at 13.00 h, 1998. For discussions of
various model simulations, see
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110102001260">Burchard et al. (2002)</a>
and also the annual simulation in the test case nns_annual and

<h2 id="northern-ns-annual">Northern NS (Annual)</h2>

<p>Here the <strong>annual simulation of the Northern Sea</strong> at 59 deg 20&rsquo; N and 1 deg
17&rsquo; E during the year 1998 as discussed by
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843430200122X">Bolding et al. (2002)</a>
is
performed. For this simulation, time series of surface slopes were extrapolated
from observations during autumn 1998 based on four partial tides by means of
harmonic analysis. All necessary meteorological data are from the UK
Meteorological Office Model in a 6-hourly temporal resolution (meteo.dat). For
the period of the PROVESS campaign (Sep 7 - Nov 7, 1998, see
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385110102001259">Howarth et al., 2002</a>
;
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843430200122X">Bolding et al., 2002</a>)
higher resolution data (half-hourly) from research vessels are available and
pasted in an extended meteo data file (meteonns.dat). See GOTM test case
nns_seasonal for a shorter term scenario only including the campaign period.
For calculating the resulting surface fluxes, the bulk formulae from
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00232256">Kondo (1975)</a>
are used here. For
the evolution of the vertical salinity profile, which is known to stabilise
stratification during summer months, a relaxation to results obtained with a
prognostic three-dimensional model of the North Sea (
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027843439590885S">Pohlmann, 1996</a>
). By
doing so, the horizontal advection, which is the dominant process for salinity
dynamics in the Northern North Sea, is parameterised.

[/caption]
The nns_annual scenario is also used as a basis for driving the
NPZD model. This is achieved by choosing fabm_calc = .true. (in gotm_fabm.nml),
and models = &lsquo;gotm_npzd&rsquo; in fabm.nml.</p>

<h2 id="ows-papa">OWS Papa</h2>

<p>This scenario is a classical scenario for the <strong>Northern Pacific</strong>, for which
long term observations of meteorological parameters and temperature profiles
are available. The station Papa at 145 deg W, 50 deg N has the advantage that
it is situated in a region where the horizontal advection of heat and salt is
assumed to be small. Various authors used these data for validating turbulence
closure schemes.

The way how bulk formulae for the surface momentum and heat
fluxes have been used here is discussed in detail in
<a href="http://io-warnemuende.de/tl_files/staff/burchard/pdf/papers/report.pdf">Burchard et al. (1999)</a>.
The maximum simulation time allowed by the included surface forcing file and
the temperature profile file is January 1 (17.00 h), 1960 - December 31 (12.00
h), 1968. In this scenario, the simulation time is run from March 25, 1961
(0.00 h) to March 25, 1962 (0.00 h). For further information, see
<a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0485(2001)031%3C1943:CAOFSM%3E2.0.CO%3B2">Burchard and Bolding (2001)</a>.</p>
