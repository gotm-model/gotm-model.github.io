      <p class="sidebar-p">GOTM is the result of the effort by a number of people to make 'state-of-the-art' turbulence model for natural waters. Since its inception more than 20 years ago GOTM has grown into a full-fledged 1D water column model with a very extended configuration possibilities including coupling to a collection of bio-geochemical models.</p>

                                  The subglacial plume scenario described in a simple geometry the vertical structure of a subglacial plume rising under a sloping ice shelf - ocean interface. This scenario has been built by Burchard et al. (2022) to develop consistent ways of coupling melting processes at the ice-ocean interface with the turbulent stucture of the plume. This principle has also been applied by Reinert et al. (2023) for a two-dimensional study with vertical resolution.

                                  The estuary scenario demonstrates in a basic manner how to calculate estuarine exchange flow by means of a water column model. Since the model has no resolution in horizontal direction, all horizontal gradients need to be prescribed. The barotropic pressure gradient is replaced by the vertically averaged time series of velocity to reproduce the tidal flow including the residual flow due to river run-off. This principle has been shown by Burchard (1999).

                                  Similar to the idealized Couette scenario, also in this test case, an unstratified, non-rotating water column of 10 m thickness is investigated. Here, however, the flow is driven by a constant barotropic pressure gradient resulting from the tilt of the free surface. The surface stress is set to zero. This type of flow is often referred to as a turbulent open channel flow. The figure below shows the stationary solution approached at the end of the simulation.

                                  The Couette scenario is the most basic of all GOTM scenarios. It represents a shallow (10 m deep), unstratified layer of fluid above a flat bottom that is driven by a constant surface stress in the x-direction. Earth&rsquo;s rotation is ignored. This flow is often referred to as a turbulent Couette flow. After the onset of the surface stress, a thin turbulent near-surface layer is generated that rapidly entrains into the non-turbulent deeper parts of the water column.

                                  The entrainment scenario is similar to the Couette scenario, except that the water column is now stably stratified by a vertically constant density gradient. Also in this scenario, the effect of Earth&rsquo;s rotation is ignored. The entrainment scenarioÂ is ideally suited to benchmark model performance in stress-driven entrainment situations against available experiments (see Umlauf and Burchard, 2005). Various yaml files corresponding to different turbulence models can be found in the scenario directory to run and compare these different models.

                                  The wave-breaking scenario has many similarities with the couette scenario: A shallow, non-rotating and unstratified water column is forced by a constant wind stress until the flow has become stationary. Now, however, near-surface turbulence generated by breaking surface waves is taken into acount as suggested by Craig and Banner (1994). In their approach, the injection of turbulence during the breaking process is modeled as a surface TKE flux that is proportional to the cube of the friction velocity.

  During stratification, hypolimnetic oxygen is depleted, and consequently phosphate is released from the reduced bottom sediments (see figure below).

                                  The observations for this scenario have been carried out by Rippeth et al (2001} in the** Liverpool Bay ROFI** on July 5 and 6, 1999 at a position of 53 deg 28.4&rsquo;N, 3 deg 39.2&rsquo;W. The dissipation rate measurements were carried out with a FLY shear probe mounted on a free-falling profiler. Sensors for temperature and conductivity attached to the profiler give detailed information on the vertical density distribution during each cast.

                                  This Northern North Sea seasonal experiment has been carried out in the framework of the PROVESS (PROcesses of VErtical mixing in Shealf Seas) project (MAS3-CT97-0025, 1998-2001) which has been funded by the European Communities MAST-III program. The observations in the Northern North Sea were carried out in September and October 1998. Here, a period of 20 days from October 7 - 27, 1998 is simulated. All forcing and validation data have been carefully processed from observations during this PROVESS-NNS experiment.

For this simulation, time series of surface slopes were extrapolated from observations during autumn 1998 based on four partial tides by means of harmonic analysis. All necessary meteorological data are from the UK Meteorological Office Model in a 6-hourly temporal resolution (meteo.

                                  This scenario is a classical scenario for the Northern Pacific, for which long term observations of meteorological parameters and temperature profiles are available. The station Papaat 145 deg W, 50 deg N has the advantage that it is situated in a region where the horizontal advection of heat and salt is assumed to be small. Various authors used these data for validating turbulence closure schemes.
